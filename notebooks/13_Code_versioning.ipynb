    "In this notebook, we'll explore the basics of code versioning using Git, a widely used version control system. Version control is essential for managing changes to your codebase, collaborating with others, and maintaining a history of your project. We'll cover the fundamental concepts of Git, how to perform common version control tasks, and best practices for organizing your code repository.\n",
