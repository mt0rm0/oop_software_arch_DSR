    "In this notebook, we'll explore the importance of logging in data science projects, how to implement logging effectively using Python's built-in logging module, and best practices for maintaining comprehensive and useful logs. Proper logging helps in debugging, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of your code over time, which is crucial for data science workflows that often involve long-running processes and complex data transformations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Logging is a critical component of any robust data science project for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Logs provide insights into the code's execution flow and help identify where errors occur.\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Logs allow you to monitor the performance and behavior of your code over time.\n",
    "- **Audit Trail**: Logs create a historical record of what your code did, which is essential for reproducibility and accountability.\n",
    "- **Communication**: Logs can help communicate the state and progress of your code to team members and stakeholders."

    "- **Use Appropriate Log Levels**: Use the appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize the importance and type of log messages.\n",
    "- **Log with Context**: Include context in your log messages to make them more informative. For example, log variable values and the state of your application.\n",
    "- **Avoid Logging Sensitive Information**: Be mindful of logging sensitive information such as passwords, personal data, or proprietary information.\n",
    "- **Configure Rotating Logs**: For long-running applications, configure log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.\n",
